Announcing a new programming tool being introduced to the OSS community,
called dradle. Imagine making your source-code modular, bug-free, reliable
and fully documented. That's what you get with dradle. Each spin of the tool
provides another facet of your code, and how productive you are depends on
your perseverance and dexterity. No longer a need to type, when each spin is
complete, the result is captured by Bluetooth into your connected device. You
are free to test it at any stage of development; just be aware that the code
you have been generating, while bug-free and complete, is totally random and
unpredictable.

You will be thrilled with hours of investigating the possibilities of dradle;
and it is guaranteed to be completely compatible with all your existing APIs,
protocols, and is fully socks compliant. It is also multi-platform; we have 
been running it on iOS, Android, Windows xp, MacOS 7, and Linux (Slackware 9
and YellowDog PPC versions.)
